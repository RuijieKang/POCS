Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for creating message-driven Microservices and It provides a connectivity to the message brokers. Something like Spring Data, with abstraction, we can produce/process/consume data stream with any message broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ) without much configuration.  The producer/processor/consumer is simplified using Java 8â€™s functional interfaces.
